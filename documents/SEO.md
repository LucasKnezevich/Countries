# SEO & Analytics


## What I've Learned
One of the most memorable aspects of SEO that we covered is how SEO looks for h1 tags and works down to h6 tags.  Specifically, it is best to only have one h1 tag per page.  Previously I thought this was good practice since this usually holds a title or something similar, so it is best to only use it once to emphasize the title for web page content.  Perhaps I had seen this before and forgot, however this is certainly something I will keep in mind when designing web pages.  Thinking about how structuring the content of a webpage is something I had not considered in relation to SEO, but it makes sense that if you have quality content that is well-organized, then you will have a better SEO score.  I also was not aware that backlinks had an influence on SEO score.  Making sure that the links going to and from a website are of good quality and made up of relatable content is another aspect of website design I will pay attention to moving forward.  

Regarding analytics; I found the information provided on a heat map to be very interesting.  When this topic was first introduced, I thought it was very intriguing, but wondered how effective it would be in a world where mobile use has become so prevalent.  Of course this seems very useful for those that still use laptops or desktops, so you can see both what is being click, but also where mouse movement is occuring (or not).  Upon further research I discovered touch and scroll heat maps, which answered my initial question about mobile use.  I think that a scroll heatmap would be incredibly useful for determining if users like to browse through your website, what they find interesting, what is hard to find, or what is uninteresting to most users.  These tools can be very helpful in determining what parts of your website or app are difficult to use, such as a button that is hard to press.  They are also a great tool to use when deciding where to put important content, or actionable items that you want the user to be aware of.

## Implementation
Some steps I would like to take:
* Research my target audience.  What brings people to a website with this content?  What information is being looked for and what different types of questions are being asked in relation to this?  This information could be used to develop better keywords, headings, and content.
* Include more content that has subheadings (h2-h6 tags).  Donâ€™t get too wordy, but try to include relevant content that has meaningful headings.
* Read more articles and investigate tools that I have briefly looked at on the Moz website.  There seem to be lots of tools for analyzing a website, generating good keywords, focusing on a target audience, etc.  Spending time to get to know some of these resources would enable me to better the SEO for this website.
