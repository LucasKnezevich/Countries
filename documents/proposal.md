## **Topic 1**: 2017/2018 Traffic Flow in Seattle

I would like to create a site that uses the 2017 and 2018 annual data from [The City of Seattle's "Traffic Flow Map Volumes" API](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Traffic-Flow-Map-Volumes/38vd-gytv).  This dataset tracks the average weekday traffic volume of speific intersections.  Using this data I want to show:
 - Where traffic flow is the heaviest.
 - Where traffic flow has increased the most between these two years.
 - Where traffic flow has decreased the most between these two years.

I think it would also be cool to include [Google Maps JS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), and add pins onto a map where these locations are.  Perhaps this is a bit advanced for my skillset, but it would be a nice addition to the site and great practice for me.

##  **Topic 2**: Currency Conversion

I would use the [CurrencyStack.io API](https://www.currencystack.io/) to create a site that calculates exchange rates between two or more selected currencies.  I see that the free version allows for up to 2,000 requests per month, so I am unsure if that is enough.  It seems like it would be, but perhaps I am underestimating the number of requests one might use when developing a site or app.

##  **Topic 3**:  Video Map

I would use both [the YouTube IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) and the [Google Map JS API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) to create a webpage that has a map with videos from the YouTube channel, [Walk Signals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrAQfTEND2rc1Qhbw4l4s7A/featured).  The main idea would be to display pins in the general area that the videos take place.  I would love to do this project since this has become my Dad's hobby and I would like to help him out.  However this seems like it might be complicated and beyond the scope of what I am capable of.
